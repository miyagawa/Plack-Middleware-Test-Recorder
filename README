NAME
    Plack::Middleware::Test::Recorder - Record requests to replay as a unit
    test

SYNOPSIS
      enable "Test::Recorder";

      # access /recorder/start to start recording
      # access /recorder/stop to stop and save a test file

DESCRIPTION
    Plack::Middleware::Test::Recorder is a Plack middleware component to
    record HTTP requests and saves them as a Perl unit test script using
    Test::WWW::Mechanize::PSGI.

TODO
    *   Work with Debug panel and such so users can input tests on browsers.

    *   Current serialization of Plack::Request is a hack. Should update
        when Plack::Request is update to support rewindable POST request.
